HTTP Request methods:
    Get: Retrieves information
    Post: Sends information/Creates new entries
    Put/Patch: Updates existing information
    Delete: Deletes information

Route: determines how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint (URI/path and HTTP request)
    Summarized in my own words:  Routes determine how the app responds to requests such as get '/items' or post '/users'.

Route syntax: app.method(path, handler)
    app: an instance of express
    method: HTTP request method
    path: a path on the server
    handler: function executed when the route is matched

Example: 
    app.get("/", (req,res) => {
        res.send("Hello World!");
    });

req.params: sends an object with the url parameter name and value
